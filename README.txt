Welcome to Book Exchange! Let's get started. 

There are two things you need to install before you can see our prototype: Node Package Manager and Meteor.js.

Downloading and Installing Node:
  Windows and OSX:
  This link (https://nodejs.org/en/) will show you how to install Node.
  
  Linux:
  Either use the above installer or check the binaries (https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) for a more recent version.
  
Downloading and installing Meteor:
  Now that node is installed, Node Package Manager, or npm, will be bundled with it. 
  Use it to install meteor with npm install meteor 
              -OR-
  Download meteor from the website: https://www.meteor.com/
  
Running our prototype:
  Open up a command shell. Navigate to the folder you installed Meteor in and type meteor. Our app will launch in localhost:3000. Enjoy!
